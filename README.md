All about Earl Higgins

Earl Higgins was born with a neuromuscular disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). SMA involves a deficiency in the proteins required to transmit nerve impulses to voluntary muscles. Symptoms include diminished or no ability to walk, as well as respiratory and other issues. In Earl's case, he was never able to stand or walk, and has used a wheelchair for mobility since age 4. He was the only student in his high school in a wheelchair, and went on to attend and graduate from the University of Iowa with a Computer Science major and a Geography minor in 1981. Since graduation, Earl has been working full-time, for such employers as Boeing Aircraft Company, Scottrade, Swedish-based Elekta Incorporated (a cancer/radiation treatment machine manufacturer), and Millipore Sigma, formerly Sigma-Aldrich (a life sciences company).

Earl and his wife Jasmine faced one of their biggest challenges in 2015 when Earl begin experiencing severe respiratory issues. This led to a six-week hospital stay resulting in a full tracheostomy and dependence on a ventilator, which several doctors assured them would be permanent. However, with perseverance, hard work, lots of help from respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, and most of all his wonderful wife Jasmine, Earl was able to regain the ability to breathe independently and had the trach removed in December, 2017.
